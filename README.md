### General Info
***
This project implements a game where a player navigates from one side of a chessboard grid to the other whilst trying to avoid hidden mines.
The player has a number of lives, losing one each time a mine is hit, and the final score is the number of moves taken in order to reach the other side of the board.
The command line / console interface should be simple, allowing the player to input move direction (up, down, left, right) and the game to show the resulting position (e.g. C2 in chess board terminology) along with number of lives left and number of moves taken.
